Setting (json) file for Windows Terminal

Please, do remember to insert your own guid's into each of the relevant settings.
The guids' used on my machine have been stripped from the setting file and replaced with the text "Run powershell command new-guid; then copy the new guid and paste into the relevant section for each of the settings. You have to do this for each section.
